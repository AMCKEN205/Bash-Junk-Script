# Bash-Junk-Script
Basic bash scripts used for management of a 'junkdir' directory, similar in principle to windows' recycle bin.

Developed as part of a Systems Programming university module coursework

.junkdir acts as a store for files no longer required by the user, this allows users to move files from regularly used directories without having to completely delete these files. junk manages the users .junkdir.

junk has two modes of operation. When junk is given no arguments a menu is displayed, allowing the user to select a function to execute  though entering  the  number it corresponds with in the menu. junk also allows users to pass in options to carry out different functions.
